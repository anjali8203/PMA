# Project Management Application

__Name:__ Anjali Mehta

I developed a full-stack project management application using Django for the back-end and PostgreSQL for the
database. I Integrated Amazon S3 to enable secure file uploads with metadata storage for user-generated content. This project designed and consumed RESTful APIs to streamline front-end and back-end communication. During this process I conducted Beta Testing to gather user feedback.
